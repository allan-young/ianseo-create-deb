Template: ianseo/default_mysql_init
Type: boolean
Description: Create ianseo's default MySQL database, user and password?
 The default MySQL root authentication setting on some Linux
 distributions can result in ianseo failing to create its database,
 user and password.  The following is optional but may simplify your
 installation.
 .
 We can create the default ianseo database (ianseo) and user (ianseo)
 with password (ianseo) right now, leaving the MySQL root account
 configuration untouched.  The ianseo application will still present
 you with a "Step 2: Database connection data" configuration page,
 when there leave the defaults in place and click the "Create
 user and database" button to proceed with the remaining database
 configuration steps.
